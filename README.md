Voice Unveiled

Project Overview
This repository contains my final presentation for the Usability course project, "Voice Unveiled." I developed this project to create a communication app designed to help individuals with Spasmodic Dysphonia speak more clearly and confidently. The focus was on user-centered design, usability research, and creating a prototype that addresses the unique challenges faced by users with this condition.
